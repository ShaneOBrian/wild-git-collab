```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
```


## STEP 5: No merge conflicts!

```{r partner 1}
### In this code chunk, start with the diamonds dataset (built in to
### ggplot2 package) and create a plot of price vs. carat (or some other
### variables of your choice)

diamonds_plot <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price, y = depth))+
  geom_line()+
  facet_wrap(~clarity)

diamonds_plot

```

```{r partner 2}
### In this code chunk, start with the diamonds dataset (built in to
### ggplot2 package) and create a subset based on filtering, e.g., 
### size greater than 1 carat or cut is "Ideal"



```

## STEP 7: Uh oh, merge conflicts!

```{r break-it-1}
depth_plot <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price, y = depth), color = color)+
  geom_line()

depth_plot
```

## STEP 11: And even more merge conflicts!

```{r break-it-2}
table_plot <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price, y = table), color = color)+
  geom_line()+
  facet_wrap(~color)

table_plot
```
